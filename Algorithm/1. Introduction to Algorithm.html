    <title>Introduction to Algorithm</title>
</head>

    <h1>What is an Algorithm</h1>
    <h2>An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions for solving a specific problem. You can solve these problems in various ways.</h2>
    <p>This means that the method you use to arrive at the same solution may differ from mine, but we should both get the same result.</p>

    <p>Learning Algorithms translates to efficiently solving a problem, every algorithm comes with it's own trades offs when it comes to performance.</p>

    <h1>Algorithm Analysis</h1>
    <p>There are multiple ways to solve a problem, for example: There are multiple algorithm to sort a list of numbers, so how do we analyse which one of them is the most effecient?</p>
    <p>Generally, when we talk about performance, we use an absolute measure. if i can run 100meters in 12 seconds, im faster than someone who takes 15 seconds.</p>
    <p>Analysing Algorithm however is slightly different.</p>
    <p>The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted, since it depends on a number of factors.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Programming language used to implement the algorithm</li>
        <li>The computer the program runs on</li>
        <li>Other programs running at the same time</li>
        <li>The quality of the operating system</li>

    </ul>
    <q><strong>Keeping this points in mind, we evaluate the performance of an algoritm in terms of it's input size</strong></q>
    <h2>The evaluation is of two types</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Time Complexity: </strong> Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size</li>
        <li><strong>Space Complexity: </strong> Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By evaluating against the input size, the analysis is not machine independent but the comparision is also appropriate</p>
    <p>There is no one solution that works every single time. it is always to solve the problem and use the best solution, given your constraints</p>
    <p>If your app need to be very quick and has plenty of memory to work with, you dont have to worry about space complexity.</p>
    <p>If you have very little momory to work with, you should pick a solution that is relatively slower but needs less space.</p>

    <h1>How to represent complexity?</h1>
    <p>Asymptotic Notations: This are mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity.</p>
    <p>There are mainly 3 Asymtotic notations</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Big-O Notation (O-Notation) - Worst Case Complexity</li>
        <li>Omega Notation (Ω-Notation) - Best Case Complexity</li>
        <li>Theta Notation (Θ-Notation) - Averrage Case Complexity</li>
    </ol>
