    <h2>Linear Search</h2>
    <p>In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.</p>

    <p>The time complexity of linear search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means that the time it takes to search the list increases linearly with the size of the list.</p>

    <p>Linear search is the simplest search algorithm, but it is also the least efficient. It is only efficient for small lists. For large lists, other search algorithms, such as binary search, are more efficient.</p>

        console.log(linearSearch([10,20,30,40,50,60], 20));

        //BIG O = O(n) - Linear Time Complexity, As the nuber of time the arrays increases, the number of time the array executes also increases.
