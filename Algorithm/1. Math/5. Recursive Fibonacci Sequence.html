    <h2>Recursive Fibonacci</h2>
    <p>In Mathematics The fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of two preceeding ones. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. (0,1,1,2,3,5,8...)</p>

            recurssion is teribble operation and not a good solution to the fibonacci sequence.
