    <title>What is asymptotic Notation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Asymptotic notations, specifically the "Big O" notation, provide a way to describe the growth rate of an algorithm's time or space complexity as the input size approaches infinity. Simply put, how much time and space an algorithm takes with a given input, n. These notations allow us to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms without getting into the specifics of constant factors or lower-order terms.</p>

    <p>Here are the commonly used asymptotic notations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Big O notation (O):</strong> The Big O notation represents the upper bound (maximum growth rate) or worst-case scenario of an algorithm's time or space complexity. It provides an upper limit on how the algorithm's performance scales with the input size. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), it means the algorithm's time requirement grows linearly or less than linearly with the input size.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Omega notation (Ω):</strong> The Omega notation represents the lower bound (minimum growth rate) or best-case scenario of an algorithm's time or space complexity. It provides a lower limit on the performance of an algorithm. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n), it means the algorithm's time requirement grows at least linearly with the input size.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Theta notation (Θ):</strong> The Theta notation represents both the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's time or space complexity. It provides a tight bound on the growth rate of an algorithm. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(n), it means the algorithm's time requirement grows linearly with the input size, and it is neither faster nor slower.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>These notations are used to describe the scalability of algorithms and how they behave as the input size becomes large. The most commonly used notation is the Big O notation, as it provides an upper bound on the growth rate, which is often the most relevant aspect to consider when analyzing algorithms.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that these notations describe the behavior of algorithms in the asymptotic sense, as the input size tends to infinity. They are not meant to provide exact measurements of performance for small input sizes or to compare algorithms for specific inputs.</p>
