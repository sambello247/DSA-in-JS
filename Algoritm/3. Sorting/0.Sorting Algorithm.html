    <h2>Sorting Algorithm</h2>
    <p>A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical (dictionary) order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output. Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The elements of the list must be in non-decreasing order.</li>
        <li>The relative order of the elements must be preserved.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are many different sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common sorting algorithms include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Bubble sort</li>
        <li>Insertion sort</li>
        <li>Quick sort</li>
        <li>Merge sort</li>
    </ul>
