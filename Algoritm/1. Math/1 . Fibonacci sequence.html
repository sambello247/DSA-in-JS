    <h2>Fibonacci Sequence</h2>
    
    <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the subsequent numbers are generated by adding the two previous numbers. So, the Fibonacci sequence begins as follows:   0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...Mathematically, the Fibonacci sequence can be defined by the following recurrence relation: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1 are the initial seed values.</p>

        The Big O of the code is O(n). This is because the number of recursive calls is proportional to n. For example, if n = 5, then there will be 5 recursive calls. The time complexity of each recursive call is O(1), so the total time complexity is O(n).
